# Udacity bikeshare Project
Created Date: November 7th, 2023

### Description
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Exploration on the Bikeshare Data Project
A project in Python that uses pandas to explore bikeshare data.

#### Program Details
The program takes user input for the city, month for which the user wants to view data, and day for which the user wants to view data. 'All' option can be used for the month or day of the week if the user desired.

Upon receiving the user input, it goes ahead and asks the user if they want to view the raw data (5 rows of data initially) or not. Following the input received, the program prints the following details:

* Most popular month
* Most popular day
* Most popular hour
* Most popular start station
* Most popular end station
* Most popular combination of start and end stations
* Total trip duration
* Average trip duration
* Types of users by number

And if available:

* Types of users by gender
* The oldest user
* The youngest user
* The most common birth year amongst users

Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.

### Files used
Files used were the following:

* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
